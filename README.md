# Horiseon Marketing Solutions Project

## Project
This is a refactoring project in which, the client Horiseon, a marketing agency was seeking to make their website more accessible to everyone. They wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards, and in doing that it ensuring that their site will be optimised for search engines.

### Acceptance Criteria
For this project the client gave an acceptance criteria. Included in this criteria were:
1. To make sure semantic elements could be found throughout the source code.
2. That the HTML elements should follow a logical structure independent of stylings and positioning.
3. Image and icon elements contain accessible 'alt' attributes (this was especially important in making sure the site followed accessibility standards)
4. Heading attributes to fall in sequential order
5. Make sure all links are functional
6. Lastly, that the title elements contained a short concise descriptive title.

### Outcome
I was able to succesfully hit all the criteria points stated above.
- The source code now has semantic elements throughout the code.
- Source code has HTML elements following a logical structure. Misplaced tags have been removed, and all tags have been closed properly.
- Image and icon elements are now following accessibility standards by the inclusion of 'alt' attributes.
